Money
The bank teller counts the money in front of George and hands it to him. “Here you are sir. That is everything you have 
in your account. I have closed it as you requested. You should receive a confirmation in the mail. Have a nice day!”
George looks at the money and takes a deep breath. It is everything he has saved. He lost his job a month ago and cannot 
find anything else. He has to use all the money from his savings account to feed his family. They were evicted from their 
apartment three days ago and now live with relatives. This money is all he has to survive until he gets another job. He 
carefully puts the money in his coat pocket and walks to the exit holding it tight. “I will guard this money with my life” 
he whispers to himself.
Three men wearing masks enter the bank. One pulls out a gun, fires a shot in the air and yells: “Everyone stay calm! This 
is a robbery! No one will get hurt if you do exactly as you are told!”
